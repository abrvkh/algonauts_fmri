# Replication of Algonauts fMRI-from-image prediction challenge

This repo replicates a minimal version of the solution of https://github.com/Hosseinadeli/algonauts2023_transformers for the Algonauts 2023 challenge (http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu). 

The file `fmri_v3.py` contains the main logic. The file `fmri_v3.ipynb` contains a baseline for a linear model.

Running the code as is (for subject 01), gives the following validation performance: 
LH correlation mean: 0.46094693171998363
RH correlation mean: 0.4641489881112636
